## Raspberry_Pi_Countdown

### Assignment Description
This assignment is to get a countdown printed in the serial monitor.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code
![Code](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Intro.py)
### Reflection
This assignment was fairly simple but I made it harder than it needed to be. It's been a while since i've done code, specifically circuit python so it took me a while to get the hang of it. Once I recalled parts of it, I figured it out.

## Raspberry_Pi_Lights
### Assignment Description
This assignment is to get a red led to blink while the countdown runs and a green led goes off at the end of the countdown.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment was ok for the most part. I'm still trying to remember everything i've learned about code. All I had to do for this assignment was to combine the two existing codes and make a new code. It was hard for me because I was overcomplicating it and not fully reading the instructions.

### Reflection
The challenging part of this assignment was adding even more wires. I hate wiring things up especially when there's a potential risk of short circuiting something. To get this assignment to work I had to

## Raspberry_Pi_servo

### Assignment Description
The goal of this assignment is to get a servo to rotate at the end of the countdown.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment requires a servo and your previous code. First, I copied my code for my button and altered it just a bit by adding the requirements for the servo.

## Raspberry_Pi_Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
The goal of this assignment is to wire an accelermoter to print out the x, y, and z values.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment looked very intimidating at first because everything looked confusing and I kind of freaked out. When I took my time to actually read it properly I realized that most of this was given to me and all I needed was to copy the code segments given and think critically about it.
