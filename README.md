## Raspberry_Pi_Countdown

### Assignment Description
This assignment is to get a countdown printed in the serial monitor.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code
![Code](https://github.com/hgeorge82/Engineering_4_Notebook/blob/main/raspberry-pi/Intro.py)
### Reflection
This assignment was fairly simple but I made it harder than it needed to be. It's been a while since i've done code, specifically circuit python so it took me a while to get the hang of it. Once I recalled parts of it, I figured it out.

## Raspberry_Pi_Lights
### Assignment Description
This assignment is to get a red led to blink while the countdown runs and a green led goes off at the end of the countdown.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment was ok for the most part. I'm still trying to remember everything i've learned about code. All I had to do for this assignment was to combine the two existing codes and make a new code. It was hard for me because I was overcomplicating it and not fully reading the instructions.

The challenging part of this assignment was adding even more wires. I hate wiring things up especially when there's a potential risk of short circuiting something. To get this assignment to work I had to

## Raspberry_Pi_servo

### Assignment Description
The goal of this assignment is to get a servo to rotate at the end of the countdown.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment requires a servo and your previous code. First, I copied my code for my button and altered it just a bit by adding the requirements for the servo.

## Raspberry_Pi_Accelerometer

### Assignment Description
The goal of this assignment is to wire an accelermoter to print out the x, y, and z values.
### Evidence 

### Wiring

### Code

### Reflection
This assignment looked very intimidating at first because everything looked confusing and I kind of freaked out. When I took my time to actually read it properly I realized that most of this was given to me and all I needed was to copy the code segments given and think critically about it.

## FEA Part 1 

### Description 
This assignment was to make a beam.
### Evidence

### Reflection
My first idea was to make a standard H beam. It was going to be a an H beam with extra beams in the middle. I tried it then quickly realized it didn't work. There was still overhang so I had to scrap that idea and start over. (I did not take picsture of my other versions...oops..).

## FEA Part 2 

### Description 
This was an assingment to make

### Reflection
I think the point of breaking will be closer to the end. I plan to reinforce this by adding trainlge holes inbetween the chamfers. If that doesn't work I plan on adding fillets to the chamfer holkes I made.


## FEA Part 3 

### Description 

### Evidence

### Reflection
While making this design I had trouble eliminating the overhang. The design was an H beam with chamfers as supports. There was an overhang so to fix this I added triangles through the supports. When I tested it there wasn't a lot of support at the end of the beam. From that test, I added fillets in hope that that would give extra support but I didn't get to test it since we ended up using Elias's beam






## 4.1 Ring and Spinner

### Assignment Description
In this assignment I had to make a spinner which is a part of the pull copter. This part will connect to the key meshing with the teeth. The top part of the spinner is where the prop will sit.

This assignnment was pretty easy. All I had to was make an offset and extrude. Then added it to the assembly.
